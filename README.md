Easy setup for synced and sorted character files.

**Installation**
1. Have Rivals Of Aether closed the entire time
2. Install github desktop
3. Navigate to C:\Users\YOU\AppData\Local\RivalsofAether\workshop and delete the files inside (and back them up, but you likely wont need them if you never modified the character lists
4. In github desktop go to file\clone repository\url, and paste the link of this page.  Set local path to C:\Users\YOU\AppData\Local\RivalsofAether\workshop **MAKE SURE IT DOESNT HAVE ROA-SETTINGS APPENDED AT THE END, HAVE IT END WITH WORKSHOP)
5. Press clone


**Use**

Having done this, any uploaded changes I make should be automatically installed when opening github desktop and accessing roa-settings.
